# ForeignGrowthAnalysis
An analysis of various disparate variables in an attempt to identify correlations with undesirable foreign growth results in a fermentation process.

Disclaimer: This data is from a real process but should not be taken out of context.  It does not represent a full accounting of the variables or results - just the subset that seemed most useful for identifying correlations.  Don't try to draw any other conclusions.

Foreign growth in fermentation is unacceptable and its presence requires the affected product to be discarded, reducing yield.  Biological processes are particularly difficult to predict due to the variables involved.  This project looks at some of the more promising variables and tries to identify those worth further investigation.
